# ðŸ’³ Banking REST API Project â€“ Code Generation 2024/2025

This repository contains the source code for a secure, structured **banking application** developed as part of the Code Generation project at Inholland University of Applied Sciences. The application consists of a fully functional **REST API built with Spring Framework (Java)**, documented with **Swagger/OpenAPI**, tested using **JUnit and Cucumber**, and complemented by a modern **JavaScript frontend** (Vue.js).

## ðŸš€ Project Description

The goal of this project is to build a complete banking system backend using RESTful principles. Starting from a Swagger specification, we implement the required functionality in Java, backed by unit and functional tests. The frontend connects to the API and provides users with an intuitive interface to interact with banking features.
